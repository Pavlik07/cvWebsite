    "bio": "My name is Pavel, I'm a frontend developer, an athlete at heart, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a passion for coding. I built my first website in 10th grade in school using html and css, but that wasn't enough for me so I studied different CMS's and stopped on WORDPRESS. Built a few projects while being in university. After graduation I was learning Java for building android apps, but soon I got back to my passion - building websites. For almost a year now, I've learned JavaScript, React, Git (and github) while repeating some basics of HTML and CSS. Still learning. Currently, I'm looking for a junior position at fine company. ",
